    <img src="img14.jpg">
    <p>Thiruvananthapuram literally means "City of Lord Anantha" in Malayalam. The name derives from the god of the Hindu temple at the centre of the city. Anantha is the serpent Shesha on whom Padmanabhan or Vishnu lies. ... However, the city is still widely referred to as "Trivandrum".</p>
    <h2>OVERVIEW</h2>
    <p>Thiruvananthapuram (IPA: [t̪iruʋənən̪t̪əpurəm] (About this soundlisten)), commonly known by its former name Trivandrum, is the capital of the Indian state of Kerala. It is the most populous city in Kerala with a population of 957,730 as of 2011.[2] The encompassing urban agglomeration population is around 1.68 million.[4] Located on the west coast of India near the extreme south of the mainland, Thiruvananthapuram is a major Information Technology hub in Kerala and contributes 55% of the state's software exports as of 2016.[7][8] Referred to by Mahatma Gandhi as the "Evergreen city of India",[9][1] the city is characterised by its undulating terrain of low coastal hills.[10]

      The Ays ruled the present region of Thiruvananthapuram until the 10th century. With their fall in the 10th century, the city was taken over by the Chera dynasty.[11] The city was later taken over by the Kingdom of Venad in the 12th century.[11] In the 17th century the king Marthanda Varma expanded the territory and founded the princely state of Travancore and Thiruvananthapuram was made capital of Travancore.[12] Following India's independence in 1947, Thiruvananthapuram became the capital of Travancore-Cochin state and remained capital when the new Indian state of Kerala was formed in 1956.[13]
